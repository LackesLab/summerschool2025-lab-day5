**Feature**: Multi-Agent AI System Project Template for Summer School
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Research Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for building a Python-based multi-agent AI system that enables collaborative feature development through a chat interface. All technical unknowns have been resolved through comprehensive technology assessment.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Package Management: UV

**Decision**: Use UV as the primary package manager for Python dependencies

**Rationale**:
- 10-100x faster than pip, providing near-instantaneous dependency resolution
- All-in-one tool replacing pip, poetry, virtualenv, and pyenv
- Excellent for educational environments - faster setup reduces student onboarding friction
- Modern Python packaging standards with `pyproject.toml` and lock files
- Rust-based performance critical for iterative development workflows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Poetry: Mature but slower dependency resolution
- pip + venv: Standard but lacks modern project management features
- Pipenv: Slower and less actively maintained

### Agent Framework: LangGraph

**Decision**: Use LangGraph for stateful multi-agent orchestration

**Rationale**:
- Purpose-built for complex, multi-step AI workflows with persistent state
- Graph-based architecture naturally models collaborative agent interactions
- Built-in streaming capabilities essential for real-time UI feedback
- Strong integration with LangChain ecosystem and LLM providers
- Educational value - students learn industry-standard agent patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom agent framework: Too complex for educational timeline
- LangChain Agents: Less sophisticated state management
- CrewAI: Limited streaming and state persistence features

**Constraints noted**:
- LangGraph v1.0 transition coming October 2025 (post-summer school)
- Requires Python 3.11+ for async features
- Learning curve for graph-based thinking

### Frontend Framework: Chainlit

**Decision**: Use Chainlit for conversational UI with integrated LangGraph support

**Rationale**:
- Minimal code required for chat interfaces - perfect for educational setting
- Native LangGraph integration with streaming support
- Built-in visualization of multi-step reasoning processes
- Real-time updates for agent collaboration visibility
- Students focus on agent logic rather than UI complexity

**Alternatives considered**:
- Streamlit: Less optimized for conversational interfaces
- FastAPI + React: Too complex for educational timeline
- Gradio: Limited agent workflow visualization

**Constraints noted**:
- Community-maintained since May 2025 (original team stepped back)
- Cross-platform deployment considerations
- Limited UI customization options

### Integration Architecture

**Decision**: Direct LangGraph-Chainlit integration with file-based document persistence

**Rationale**:
- Chainlit's `cl.LangchainCallbackHandler()` provides seamless streaming
- File system storage simple and educational (students can inspect outputs)
- Async/await patterns align with modern Python practices
- Real-time agent collaboration visualization enhances learning

**Implementation pattern**:
```python
@cl.on_chat_start
async def on_chat_start():
    # Initialize LangGraph workflow

@cl.on_message
async def on_message(message):
    # Stream graph execution with callbacks
```

## File Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Organized directory structure with markdown documents

**Rationale**:
- Markdown format specified in requirements (FR-015)
- Human-readable for educational inspection
- Version control friendly for project evolution
- Simple file I/O reduces complexity

**Structure**:
```

├── feature_requests/     # Original user descriptions
├── clarifications/       # Q&A interactions
├── requirements/         # Generated requirements docs
├── technical_analysis/   # Tech stack recommendations
├── reviews/             # Product/technical reviews
└── implementation/      # Final implementation guides
```

## Agent Collaboration Model

**Decision**: Supervisor pattern with specialized agent roles

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns for educational understanding
- Supervisor orchestrates workflow stages matching requirements (FR-006)
- Each agent has distinct responsibilities aligned with software development phases
- Parallel processing where possible for performance

**Agent Roles**:
1. **Clarification Agent**: Analyzes input, asks follow-up questions (FR-003, FR-004)
2. **Requirements Agent**: Generates structured requirements documents (FR-007)
3. **Technical Agent**: Analyzes tech stack and architecture decisions (FR-010)
4. **Product Agent**: Reviews from product management perspective (FR-010)
5. **Testing Agent**: Defines testing strategies and validation approaches (FR-006)

## Performance Considerations

**Target Response Times**:
- Initial clarification response: <2 seconds
- Full agent collaboration workflow: <30 seconds
- Document generation: <5 seconds per document
- Real-time streaming updates: <500ms latency

**Scalability Approach**:
- Single user sessions (FR-014)
- In-memory state for active workflows
- File-based persistence for completed workflows
- Async processing for non-blocking UI

## Development Environment Setup

**Python Requirements**: 3.11+ (LangGraph async features)
**Key Dependencies**:
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "uv>=0.5.0",
    "langgraph>=0.3.0",
    "chainlit>=1.3.0",
    "langchain>=0.3.0",
    "openai>=1.0.0"  # or other LLM providers
]
```

**Development workflow**:
1. `uv init` for project creation
2. `uv add` for dependency management
3. `chainlit run` for development server
4. `pytest` for testing (contract and integration tests)

## Educational Considerations

**Onboarding Target**: 15 minutes (FR-001)
- Clear README with setup instructions
- Working example in <5 commands
- Documentation explains agent patterns
- Code comments highlight learning objectives

**Repository Structure**: Intuitive navigation (FR-012)
- Standard Python project layout
- Examples directory with sample workflows
- Clear separation between framework and student code
- Progressive complexity in examples

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Technology stability (UV, LangChain ecosystem mature)
- Development timeline (well-scoped for summer school)
- Performance requirements (achievable with chosen stack)

**Medium Risk**:
- LangGraph v1.0 transition (post-summer school timing acceptable)
- Student learning curve for graph-based thinking
- LLM API rate limits and costs

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Fallback patterns for API failures
- Clear error messages and debugging guides
- Cost management through local model options

## Next Phase Preparation

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items resolved. Ready for Phase 1 design:
- Data model definition for entities (agents, workflows, documents)
- API contracts for agent interactions
- Integration patterns for LangGraph-Chainlit
- Test scenarios from user stories
- Quickstart implementation guide

**Research Complete**: ✅ All technical unknowns resolved, technology stack validated for educational use case.
