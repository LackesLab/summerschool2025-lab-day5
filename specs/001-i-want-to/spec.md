# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent AI System Project Template for Summer School

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to create a project template that help the students of my summorschool and is the base for days 5 of the lab. The students should be able to onboard fast and get a clear understanding of the repository structure. The overall goal for the students should be building an agent system that uses multi generative ai agents backed by LLMs to collaborate with each other. They will be tasked to develop requirements and implementation guide for a feature the user can describe via a chat interface. One of the agent analyzes these user inputs and should be able to aks for clarification of unclear user statements. The user should then answer and the agent collaboration starts in the background. There will be multiple agents, each with a different task. The final result should be multiple documents which can then be used to start the implementation. These user should be encouraged to break down the process of building software features into smaller tasks like "define requirements", "analyze tech stack", review the proposed solution from a technical or product manager perspective, reiterate, test etc. And these intermediate steps should be stored in files and in addition also be output via user interface to the user."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Extracted: multi-agent AI system for feature development workflow
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: students, AI agents, users (feature requesters)
   � Actions: chat interface, clarification, collaboration, document generation
   � Data: feature descriptions, requirements, implementation guides
   � Constraints: educational context, file storage, UI output
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow identified: chat � clarification � agent collaboration � documents
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement tested for clarity and measurability
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Feature requests, agents, documents, workflow stages
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec reviewed for business focus and clarity
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A summer school student receives the project template and can quickly understand the repository structure. They start building a multi-agent AI system where users describe features through a chat interface. The system uses multiple AI agents to collaborate on breaking down feature requests into detailed requirements and implementation guides. Each intermediate step is saved as files and displayed in the user interface, teaching students the systematic approach to software feature development.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new student opens the project template, **When** they read the documentation, **Then** they understand the repository structure and can identify where to start coding
2. **Given** a user describes a feature via chat interface, **When** the clarification agent detects unclear statements, **Then** the system asks specific clarifying questions
3. **Given** clarifying questions are answered, **When** the agent collaboration begins, **Then** multiple agents work on different tasks (requirements, tech analysis, review) simultaneously
4. **Given** agents complete their tasks, **When** the workflow finishes, **Then** multiple structured documents are generated and displayed to the user
5. **Given** intermediate workflow steps are completed, **When** each step finishes, **Then** results are both saved to files and shown in the user interface

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user provides an extremely vague feature description?
- How does the system handle when agents disagree or provide conflicting recommendations?
- What occurs if the agent collaboration process takes an unusually long time?
- How does the system behave when file storage fails during document generation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a clear, well-documented project template that students can understand within  15 minutes
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a chat interface where users can describe features in natural language
- **FR-003**: System MUST have a clarification agent that can identify unclear or ambiguous statements in user input
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow the clarification agent to ask specific follow-up questions to users
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable multiple AI agents to collaborate simultaneously on different aspects of feature development
- **FR-006**: System MUST break down feature development into specific workflow stages (requirements definition, tech stack analysis, solution review, testing strategy)
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate structured documents for each workflow stage
- **FR-008**: System MUST save all intermediate results and final documents to files in a organized directory structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST display workflow progress and results in the user interface in real-time
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide different agent perspectives including technical review and product management review
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow for iterative refinement of requirements and solutions based on agent feedback
- **FR-012**: Repository structure MUST be intuitive enough for students to navigate without extensive training
- **FR-013**: System MUST demonstrate collaborative AI agent patterns as a learning tool for students
- **FR-014**: System MUST support single user
- **FR-015**: Generated documents MUST follow markdown guidelines

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feature Request**: User-submitted description of desired functionality, including original text and clarified requirements
- **Agent**: AI entity with specific role (clarification, requirements analysis, tech review, product review), maintains state and task progress
- **Workflow Stage**: Discrete step in feature development process (requirements, analysis, review, testing), with defined inputs/outputs
- **Generated Document**: Structured output from agent collaboration, includes requirements docs, implementation guides, review feedback
- **Student Session**: Individual learning session with progress tracking, file organization, and workflow history
- **Repository Template**: Base project structure with documentation, examples, and scaffolding for student development
